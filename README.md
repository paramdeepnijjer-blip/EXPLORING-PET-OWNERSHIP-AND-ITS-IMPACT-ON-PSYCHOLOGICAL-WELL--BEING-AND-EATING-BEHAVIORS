**Author:** Paramdeep Nijjer  
**Program:** B.Sc. Applied Statistics, MacEwan University  
**Capstone:** STAT 496 – Applied Statistics Consulting Project  
**Tools:** R, RMarkdown, ggplot2, lavaan, psych, tidyverse

## 📘 Project Overview
This consulting project investigates how **pet ownership** and **attachment to pets** relate to indicators of **mental health and disordered eating behaviors**.  
Using survey data from over **600 participants**, the project applied rigorous **statistical modeling, correlation analysis, and mediation testing** to uncover meaningful insights into emotional well-being.

The goal was to provide actionable, data-driven evidence to guide **mental health researchers** and **community programs** studying the psychological role of pet companionship.

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Pet ownership and attachment correlated with **higher depression and anxiety scores**, suggesting complex emotional dynamics.  
- **Mediation analysis** revealed that depression and negative mood **partially mediate** the relationship between pet ownership and disordered eating risk.  
- Statistical models (ANOVA, Regression, SEM) indicated significant — though small — predictive effects, emphasizing the **multifactorial nature** of psychological health.  
- Produced clean, reproducible analytics using RMarkdown, with transparent methodology and visual storytelling.
